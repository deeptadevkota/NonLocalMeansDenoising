# NonLocalMeansDenoising

## The following algorithms are implemented:

1) Non-local means algorithm for image denoising
2) Improved Non-local means filtering algorithm for image denoising
3) Median Non-local means-based filter
4) Bhattacharyya distance based non-local means filter
5) Efficient Non-local means denoising using the SVD
6) Non-local means filtering using Pearson correlation distance
